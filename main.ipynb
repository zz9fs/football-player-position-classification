    "     \"\\n\",\n",
    "     \"Welcome to the main notebook for reproducing the results of the project.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"## Project Overview\\n\",\n",
    "     \"This project aims to predict a football (soccer) player's on-field position using player attributes (e.g., Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defense, Physicality). We compare performance using different dataset sizes and models:\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- **Original Dataset** (~19k rows): `all_players.csv`\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- **Expanded Dataset** (~28k rows): `expanded_all_players.csv` (obtained by integrating older FC21 data)\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"We use Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models. We also explore how data volume and preprocessing steps (like SMOTE or PCA) impact performance.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"## Repository Contents\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- `README.md`: General overview and instructions.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- `all_players.csv`: Original dataset (~19k instances).\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- `expanded_all_players.csv`: Expanded dataset (~28k instances) with additional FC21 data.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- `original-players-model-training.ipynb`: Notebook for training and evaluating models on the original dataset.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- `expanded-players-model-training.ipynb`: Notebook for training and evaluating models on the expanded dataset.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"**Note:** Currently, the repository appears to have only these key files. If more notebooks or scripts are added later (e.g., for preprocessing, evaluation, or feature engineering), update these instructions accordingly.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"## Steps to Reproduce\\n\",\n",
    "     \"\\n\",\n",
    "     \"### 1. Set up the environment\\n\",\n",
    "     \"1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"2. Install required packages. If you have a `requirements.txt` file, run:\\n\",\n",
    "     \"```bash\\n\",\n",
    "     \"pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\",\n",
    "     \"```\\n\",\n",
    "     \"If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, ensure that you have essential packages like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, and `matplotlib` installed.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"### 2. Prepare the Data\\n\",\n",
    "     \"This repository includes two datasets:\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- `all_players.csv` (original dataset)\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- `expanded_all_players.csv` (expanded dataset)\\n\",\n",
    "     \"Make sure they are located in the repository root directory as shown.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"### 3. Run the Original Dataset Model Training\\n\",\n",
    "     \"Open `original-players-model-training.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- This notebook will load `all_players.csv`, train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, and provide performance metrics.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- It may also include code to compare scenarios (e.g., with/without PCA, SMOTE) if implemented in that notebook.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"By running this notebook, you can reproduce the experiments on the ~19k instance dataset.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"### 4. Run the Expanded Dataset Model Training\\n\",\n",
    "     \"Open `expanded-players-model-training.ipynb` and run all cells.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- This notebook will use `expanded_all_players.csv` to train the same or similar models.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- It will demonstrate how performance changes when we incorporate the older FC21 data, resulting in a larger, more diverse dataset (~28k instances).\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"By running this notebook, you can reproduce experiments that show improved performance for ensemble methods and the beneficial impact of SMOTE on the larger dataset.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"### 5. Compare and Analyze Results\\n\",\n",
    "     \"After running both notebooks:\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- Compare results from `original-players-model-training.ipynb` and `expanded-players-model-training.ipynb`.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- Note differences in accuracy, F1-scores, and the effect of SMOTE/PCA if implemented.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- These comparisons align with the discussions and conclusions in the final report (if provided separately).\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"### Additional Notes\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- If you add preprocessing steps or feature engineering, you may consider creating a separate notebook for data cleaning and link it here.\\n\",\n",
    "     \"- If you use PCA or SMOTE, ensure that code cells are included in the training notebooks.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "     \"## Conclusion\\n\",\n",
    "     \"By following the steps above, you can reproduce the model training and evaluation processes for both the original and expanded datasets. This allows you to confirm the reported improvements in model performance when the dataset is larger and more diverse.\\n\"\n",
